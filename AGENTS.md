# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Auto-Deploy After Every Task

After completing any coding task that results in working changes:
1. `git add . && git commit -m "<descriptive message>"`
2. `git push origin main`
3. `npx vercel --prod`
Do NOT ask for approval — just do it. Only skip if the build fails.
